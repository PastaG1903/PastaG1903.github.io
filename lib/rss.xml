 <br><br>Hello, everyone.<br>This will be where I will be submitting and recording whatever I do everyday for my master's thesis project. More specifically, I will be recording the activities mainly for the experimental part (since the main thing of the theoretical part is code, so that is easier) unless stated otherwise: whenever I make relevant changes in the code (relevant means that it changes the result) I will describe them on the corresponding day.<br>I will be dividing this in weeks and in each week, it will be divided into the different days, including weekends in some situations, in case I just get an idea during those days. Otherwise, it will mainly be composed of Monday - Friday.<br>Ideas, thoughts and/or conclusions from activities will be in italics, as something to take into account for future related activities.<br>Any suggestions in the changes of format or arrangement are welcome.]]></description><link>index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">index.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:55:23 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
