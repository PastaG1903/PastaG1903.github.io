An attempt was made to seal the hole with the PDMS sample. As described in last Saturday's notes [[Week 2]], a PDMS piece was cut with an area slightly bigger than the hole to cover. Something to note is that the hole in the microchannel has a square shape, but the hole made in the bottom acetate layer is rectangular, this was initially to expose some of the PSA glue and directly paste the substrate. This idea was discarded, as humidity and manipulation made the device non-reusable.

Looking at it another way, the glue and the acetate layers are in different levels. In the near micro scale, the adhesion was not perfectly leveled or aligned, which lead to leakages and further substrate detachment.

The same device was used for the idea mentioned above. In this scenario, instead of relying on adhesion or attachment caused by in-device materials (such as PSA layer), an external piece of PSA was used to keep the PDMS piece in place.

The device was placed upside down on a table, and the substrate was carefully placed on the hole. A small strip of PSA was placed on the substrate and device as follows: the center of the strip was pressed against the substrate; holding that pressure by hand, each side of the strip was pulled to maximize pressure and placed on the acetate layer. Only after both ends of the strip were pasted/placed, the pressure by hand was released.

Enough rotational speed (not tracked) was used to get the fluid to the other side of the substrate. Reciprocation was achieved successfully.

The issue that rose was that the substrate could not maintain the generated pressure for relatively long times or leakage occurs.

Regardless of the method used to attach (externally) the substrate onto the device, enough pressure maintained for enough time will cause leakage. An option to use this implementation is to redesign the device so that less pressure is necessary or to use the same design, but use high relaxation times (reverse flow time >> forward flow time) to have enough pressure relaxation to prevent leakages when the device accelerates again.
